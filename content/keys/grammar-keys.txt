Terrorism  has  been  a  global  problem  for  airlines 
for  decades.  However,  although  security  at  airports 
has always been tight,  the 9/11  attacks made it clear 
that new measures were necessary.  As a result,  many 
new security procedures  have been  put  into  practice. 
A good rule is to plan ahead and prepare for the strict
est security policies. Common sense and wise planning 
are the keys to a successful trip.

One of the most important security measures at an 
airport is confirming the identity of travellers. This is 
done by checking a photo ID, such as a driver’s license. 
If you are travelling internationally, you need to show 
your passport. Simply taking a look at a photo ID isn’t 
enough,  however.  The  high-tech  buzzword  in  airport 
security  today  is  biometrics.  Biometrics  essentially 
means checking fingerprints,  retinal scans,  and facial 
patterns using complex computer systems to determine, 
if someone is who they say they are — or if they match 
a list of people the government has determined might 
be potential terrorists.

Here  are  a  few  tips  to  keep  in  mind  for  passing 

carry-on security screening:

1) Check with your air carrier for specific check-in 
times if you are a carry-on traveller. Remember screen
ing  lines  will  be  longer  during  peak  travel  time  and 
holidays.



2)  Prepare  for  security  screening,  not  ju st  your 
carry-on items but your check-in luggage and your per
son as well.

3) Be ready to answer any questions and do not accept 
items from strangers. Keep your luggage and personal 
belongings with you at all time.

4)  Any  metal  item  (buttons,  zippers,  hair  accesso
ries, etc.) can set off metal detectors. You can minimize 
screening time by reducing the number of these items 
on your person.

5) You should carry proper identity to indicate any 

medical metal implants.

remove your shoes.

6)  Shoes  can  trigger  alarms.  You  may be asked  to 

7) Be  prepared  to open and  activate  carry-on elect
ronic items such as: laptops, cameras, cell phones* etc.
8) Avoid further delay by waiting  to  lock  carry-on 
luggage  until  you’ve  passed  through  screening  areas. 
Any wrapped packages may be searched, so wait to wrap 
any gifts  or,  if  possible,  pack  such  items  in  check-in 
luggage.

9)  Avoid  additional  scrutiny  by  not  carrying  pro
hibited items, such as all cutting and puncturing items, 
flammable liquids and containers under pressure such 
as aerosols,  matches and lighters,  toy weapons, etc.

All rules and practices regarding security, carry-ons, 
and  other  airline  /   airport  practices  are  subject  to 
change without notice,  so it is best to call your airline 
or check with the airport just before the departure for 
the latest updates.

In  2016,  The  International  Olympic  Committee 
approved  five  new  sports  to  become  p a rt  of  the 
2020  Summer  Olympics  in  Tokyo.  These  sports  are

Контрольные упражнения

baseball  I  softball,  karate,  skateboarding  (отглаголь
ное  существительное),  sport  climbing  (отглагольное 
существительное)  and  surfing  (отглагольное  суще
ствительное).  They  were  added  to  the  existing  (при
лагательное)  28  Olympic  sports.

Baseball  is  a bat-and-ball  game.  It  is  played  by  two 
opposing (прилагательное) teams of nine players each. 
Softball  is  a  variant  of  baseball.  Having  (причастие) 
evolved from older games played in England in the  18th 
century, baseball was brought to North America by im
migrants.  By the late  19th century, baseball became the 
most popular sport in the United States.  Today baseball 
is  popular  in  North  America  and  parts  of  Central  and 
South America,  the  Caribbean  and  East Asia.

Karate  is  a  Japanese  martial  art.  It  was  created  as 
a  form  of  self-defence  in  Okinawa.  Little  is  known  of 
the ancient origins of karate.  It is believed it came from 
India  over  a  thousand  years  ago,  brought  to  China by 
a  Buddhist  monk.  Later,  it  was  brought  to  Okinawa 
by  Chinese  visitors.  Today  karate  is mostly  a striking 
(прилагательное) art using (предлог) punching (герун
дий),  kicking  (герундий),  knee  strikes,  elbow  strikes 
and open-hand techniques.  Having (причастие) evolved 
into  a  popular  sport,  it  is  taught  all  over  the  world.

Surfing (отглагольное существительное) is a water 
sport  in  which  the  surfer  rides  a  moving  (герундий) 
wave, which is usually carrying (причастие) the surfer 
towards  the  shore.  For  centuries,  surfing  (отглаголь
ное  существительное)  was  a  central  part  of  ancient 
Polynesian  culture.  Modern surfing (отглагольное  су
ществительное) was established as  a sport in the early 
20th  century.  Having  developed  in  Hawaii,  Australia 
and  California,  today’s  surfers  represent  a  diverse 
culture.  Some  practice  it  as  a  recreational  activity, 
others  make  it  the  focus  of  their  lives.

Skateboarding  (отглагольное  существительное) 
is  a  sport  involving  (предлог)  riding  (герундий)  and 
performing  (герундий)  tricks  on  a  skateboard.  Skate-

  8 4  
boarding  (отглагольное  существительное)  appeared 
in California in the  1950s when  surfers started surf
ing  (герундий)  the  streets.  The  first  skateboarding 
(причастие) enthusiasts used boards with roller-skate 
wheels attached on the bottom. The.first skateboarding 
(отглагольное  существительное)  competitions  were 
held in the  1960s.  Starting (предлог) with the  1970s 
the sport gained popularity. Today there are more than 
11 million active skateboarders in the world.
Sport climbing (отглагольное существительное) is 
a form of rock climbing (отглагольное существительное). 
Although  traditional  rock  climbing  (отглагольное 
существительное)  originated  in  the  19th  century, 
sport  climbing  (отглагольное  существительное) was 
introduced  in  the  1980s.  Unlike  traditional  climb
ing (отглагольное  существительное),  sport climbing 
(отглагольное существительное) relies on permanent 
anchors fixed to the rock for protecting (герундий) the 
climber from falling (герундий). The sport emphasises 
strength, stamina,  gymnastic ability and technique.

The Earth’s climate has changed many times during 
the planet’s history, with events ranging from ice ages 
to long periods of warmth. Historically, natural factors 
such  as  volcanic  eruptions,  changes  in  the  Earth’s 
orbit, and the amount of energy released from the Sun 
have  affected  the  Earth’s  climate.  For  over  the  past 
200  years,  the  burning  of  fossil  fuels,  such  as  coal 
and oil,  and deforestation have caused the concentra
tions of “greenhouse gases” in our atmosphere.  These 
gases  prevent  heat  from  escaping  to  space,  causing 
the  atmosphere  to  become  warmer.  Global  warming 
is the increase in the average temperature of Earth’s 
near-surface air and oceans since the mid-20th century. 
So human  activities  have  changed the composition  of

the atmosphere and therefore are very likely influenc
ing  the  E arth’s  climate.  But  climate  change  affects 
people,  plants,  and  animals.  Scientists  have  observed 
that some changes are occurring at present.  Observed 
effects include sea level rise, melting glaciers, changes 
in  the  range  and  distribution  of  plants  and  animals, 
trees blooming earlier, lengthening of growing seasons, 
ice  on  rivers  and  lakes  freezing  later  and  breaking 
up  earlier,  and  thawing  of  permafrost.  Scientists  are 
working to understand better future climate changes.

a)  Причастие  I:  ranging,  causing,  influencing, 
occuring,  blooming,  growing,  freezing,  breaking  up, 
working;

b) Герундий:  escaping,  shrinking;
c) Отглагольное существительное: burning, warming, 

lengthening,  thawing.
